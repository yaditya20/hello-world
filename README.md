# hello-world

Hello Everyone!!

I am Aditya Yadav currently pursuing my graduation degree in BSc Computer Science from Vartak College. I know a bit about Java, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Android, C, C++, PHP. I am also learning few technologies from NIIT and would like to implement them once I complete the courses. I love fidgetting with stuffs such as new technology or any thing that sounds different then usual. I like reviewing smartphones and play around with them. Here at GitHub am trying to explore the other side of me and start making my own projects.
